# My Simple Dotfiles

Simple, customization of BASH, TMUX, and Vim. 

## Installation

Once the repo is cloned into `~/`, execute the deploy script:
```
./deploy
```

This script guides you through the following:

1. Checks if you have bash, tmux, and vim installed. 
2. Appends .old to your old configuration files.
3. Creates new configuration files, that contain a link to the repo.
